Python3.x vs Python2.x
</h1>

### Why learn Python3 instead of Python2? What are the differences?
Python3.x is more in-demand and includes a typing system. Python2.x is 
outdated and uses an older syntax for the print function. While Python 2 
is still in use for configuration management in DevOps, Python 3 is the 
current standard.

Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, was unhappy with the architectural
decisions made within the programming language. He wanted to change them and
overhaul Python. Therefore, this led him to releasing Python3. The goal was
for the language to be the present and the future.

Since **Python3.x is not backwards compatible** with Python2.x, this was a major
problem at firstâ€”lot of companies had their source code written in 
Python2.x. If they were to start using Python3.x, it had to be the company
decision to do so. Unlike the other languages, such as JavaScript, if their
script was written 5 years ago and someone were to run the code today, it
would still be able to run fine despite all the new updates to JavaScript
that have occurred since the script has been written.
