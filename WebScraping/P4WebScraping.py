==============================
    Web Scraping Project
==============================
In this project the user will be building a quotes guessing game. When run, your program will scrape a website for
a collection of quotes. Pick one at random and display it. The player will have four chances to guess who said the
quote. After every wrong guess they'll get a hint about the author's identity.
