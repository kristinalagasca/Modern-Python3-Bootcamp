Numbers, Operators, and Comments
</h1>

### Objectives
* Understand the differences between ints and floats
* Work with simple mathematical operators
* Adding comments to code

 #### *Int vs Float*
Integer and Float are both two different types of numerical data. An *integer* is a 
whole number with no decimal. A *float* or floating-point number is a number that has 
a decimal place and is used when more precision is needed. Integers, however, take up 
less memory than floating-point numbers.

#### *Basic Math*

Python follows the PEMDAS rule when it comes to mathematics.
These are the most commonly used math operators:

Symbol | Name 
---|---
\+ | Addition
\- | Subtraction
\* | Multiplication
\/ | Division
\** | Exponentiation
\% | Modulo
\// | Integer Divison

For the weirder mathematical operators within Python, here are some examples of 
how they are used, and the result that will be returned:

    Exponentiation:
    2 ** 3 = 8      # 2 to the power of 3 equals 8

    Modulo:
    10 % 3 = 1      # 10 mod 4 equals 1

    Integer Divison:
    10 // 3 = 2     # 10 divided by 3 equals 3

#### *Comments*
Comments within the Python script are a way for the user to remind themselves of 
certain things within the program. Although Python code should be easily readable—not 
just to the user, but to anyone else who interacts with the script—that is not always 
the case. They can be indicated with the # or triple quotes for multiple lines of 
comments.
