Mac OSX/Linux Command Line Fundamentals
</h1>

### Objectives:
* Define what the command line is
* Learn command line navigation and file structure
* Learn to manipulate files and folders via command line
---

### What the command line does:

The command line is a faster and more powerful way to maneuver your 
operating system than by using a GUI, such as Windows Explorer or Mac 
Finder.

We use special keywords to do everything that we normally can with a 
GUI and more.

Operating systems organize their folders in a hierarchy (like a tree), 
with parents and children all relative to a base root directory.
